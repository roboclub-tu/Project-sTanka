# Project sTanka

**Project sTanka** is an innovative initiative by the [Roboclub](https://www.roboclub.bg/) at the [Technical University of Sofia](https://tu-sofia.bg/), focusing on the development of a hand-gesture recognition system to control a tank-like robot. This project seamlessly integrates computer vision and IoT technologies to offer an intuitive and responsive user experience.

## Overview

The primary objective of Project sTanka is to enable users to maneuver a robotic tank using specific hand gestures. This is achieved through a combination of:

- **Hand-Gesture Recognition:** Utilizing a computer vision system trained to identify predefined gestures, which are then translated into movement commands for the robot.
- **IoT Communication:** Implementing the SmartConfig feature of the ESP32 microcontroller to establish a seamless connection between the laptop and the robot over Wi-Fi.
- **Hardware Integration:** Employing an ESP32 microcontroller on the robot to process incoming commands and control its movements accordingly.

## Technologies Used

- **Microcontroller Programming:** The ESP32 microcontroller is programmed using the Arduino platform, facilitating efficient control of the robot's hardware components.
- **Hand-Gesture Recognition:** The system leverages Python, Jupyter Notebook, TensorFlow, and OpenCV to develop and train the gesture recognition model, ensuring accurate and real-time gesture detection.

## Key Features

- **Real-Time Gesture Control:** Immediate response to user gestures, ensuring smooth and natural interaction with the robot.
- **Wireless Communication:** Reliable and fast data exchange over Wi-Fi, facilitated by the ESP32's SmartConfig feature, which simplifies network provisioning.
- **Customizable Gestures:** The system can be trained to recognize a variety of gestures, allowing for personalized control schemes.
